*Feb 18, 2025, 7:06 am*
**Major Additions**
- New Units!
  - Artillery
    - Capable of attacking but not defense
  - Tanks
     - Very fast on flatter terrains
   - Fuel is also now a shop item, required for the above two as well as other pre-existing units. To view fuel requirements by type do `-fuelreq`
- Rails
  - Transport units from one station to another, if they're connected by rails
  - To view your rails, do `-rails`
  - To pave a railroad, do `-pave <territory1> <territory2>`. To view the prices do `-pave <territory> prices`
  - To move a unit from one rail station to another do `-haul <unit> <destination>`. This includes naval units! (Though moving a naval unit inland will render it useless until its moved out again)
  - To view a map of all railroads in either a nation or the world, do `-railmap <all/nation>`
  - To build a railway station do `-build <territory> Railway Station` or `-build <territory> rail`. (This command is mostly for future buildings, but has been made to include forts as well. regardless, `-fortify` still exists)
  - To find the shortest path from one territory to another, do `-pathfrom <territory1> <territory2> <(optional settings)>`.  Optional settings are `nation` (path will be contained in a nation) and `rail` (path is only between rail stations). This is useful either for deciding where to build rail or how to transport units
- Terrain
  - Affect cooldown and railroad price. To view all terrains do `-terrainmap`. 
  - To view the cooldown times by terrain for a specific unit, do `-unitcooldowns <unit>`
- Legend Map

- `-reset` - Reset command for admins only. Makes my life easier :)
**Minor Changes**
- Reduced cooldowns for naval units to hopefully get more use out of them. Submarines are the fastest, followed by destroyers, followed by carriers. All were reduced by some amount
- Changed how the shop looks
- Changed tax formula
- Removed `-toppop`. It's now `-top pop`
- Overhauled how cooldowns work. Unit cooldown based on attacking/movement is now calculated at the start instead of at the end, meaning a unit will be able to attack and move at the same time. As such, `-cooldowns att` and `-cooldowns move` have been replaced by just `-cooldowns unit`
- You can no longer cede provinces with units on it
- `-inv` will no longer display items you have 0 of
- Prices for upgrading are now based on density and terrain

  - Set the tax by doing `-settax <tax rate>`
    - There is no longer min, mod, max, or evil - you pick your people's tax rate!
    - Must be a positive integer
  - Collect tax by doing `-collect`
    - This will collect all tax even while you were inactive. You can do it a minimum of every 30 minutes (which can of course change through master settings)
    - Additionally, the longer you wait the less you will collect per hour
**Along with this, there were many, many bug fixes…**
  - Fixed a bug with the `-fuelreq` command and added a few things to `-help` (probably not enough)

  - Fixed a bug that occured when nations would get annexed but still have ships 
    - If these ships are carriers aboard which there are ground forces, the nation still lives to fight another day. If not, the winning nation seizes all defendant ships

  - Fixed `-wars` breaking whenever a nation is annexed

# Update 1.4 - Power & Principle
*Jul 20, 2025, 9:22 am*
**The long awaited Update 1.4 is here, reshaping international power dynamics and allowing you to shape the future of your country. Three major additions- formables, ideologies, and resources- plus tons of other changes will certainely make this update live up to the hype.**
**Major Additions**
- Formables
  - You can now form nations greater than their current meek form.
  - To view your formables, do `-form`
  - To become a formable, do `-form <formable>`. You will then adopt the name and flag of this new nation
    - You must hold onto all its territory, be at peace, and follow the ideology if any
    - You will gain much needed stability, and instant integration
  - To view a map of the formable as well as additional information, do `-formable <formable>`
  - To view the requirements needed for a formable (most notably, all its territories needed), do `-formreq <formable>`
- Ideologies
  - There are 10 ideologies in the game, each of which have certain buffs and debuffs. 
  - To view all ideologies, do `-ideologies`
  - To view the specifics of a single ideology, do `-viewide <ideology>`
  - To set your ideology, do `-setide <ideology>`. This costs 250 political power
- Resources
  - There are two types of naturally occuring resources in the game: Oil and Coal
  - Coal is produced automatically. Oil however requires an **Oil Drill** to be built on the province that has the oil
  - Coal and Oil must be processed in a **Fuel Refinery** to be converted into fuel. 
    - 1 Coal -> 0.5 Fuel
    - 1 Oil -> 1.5 Fuel
  - The above rates are every tax cooldown (so 30 minutes as of now), per fuel refinery.
  - All natural and manufactured resources are automatically added to your inventory
  - View a map of naturally occuring resources by doing `-resmap <resource>`
**Other Additions/Changes**
- Political Power: a new stat that is used to switch ideologies. It, like stability, decreases as the tax rate increases
- Battleships no longer require Ammunition, and the bugs surrounding them have been patched, hopefully
- Copius Amounts of gasoline has been removed from the market. To scorch a province, 20 fuel is required. Scorching also gets rid of all buildings, so if you're being conquered and have vital buildings you dont want to give your enemy access to, scorch the province.
- Due to the additions of Fuel Refineries, the initial price of Fuel has been raised to $600. Better get those factories running quick!
- Added a news channel, #world-news 
- You can no longer cede your final province
- `-t` territories are now sorted by descending population
- oil and coal have been added as options to `-top`
- Annexing a country results in stability gain except if you're a democracy
- New command,`-buildmap <building>`, that shows all buildings built so far

# Update 1.5 - The Diplomacy Update
*Dec 19, 2025 12:38 pm*
**Major Additions**
- Diplomacy
  - Alliances
     - An alliance is a type of relationship with another nation where you will be called into all their defensive wars, and they will be called into all your defensive wars. You are not allowed to declare war on allies.
    - Request/Accept an alliance with `-ally <nation>`
    - Cancel an alliance or alliance request with `-cancel ally <nation>`
    - You may call in allies into offensive wars. Do this with `-callin <nation> <war>`
      - To join a war you've been called into, do `-joinwar <war>`
  - Non-Aggression Pacts
    - A non-aggression pact (or NAP for short) is a type of relation where you will not be allowed to declare war on them and vice versa. 
    - This is unless you have the ideology of fascism, which allows you to break NAPs without consequence
    - Request/Accept an NAP with `-nap <nation>`
    - Cancel an NAP or NAP request with `-cancel nap <nation>`
  - There is a 6 hour truce after breaking an alliance or NAP
  - View all allies and NAPs with `-diplomacy`
  - View all alliance, NAP, and call to war requests with `-offers`
- Peace Treaties
  - Treaties got a complete revamp this game. This means `-peace`, `-accept`, `-reject`, and `-treaties` were all removed.
  - The command for creating a peace treaty is `-draft`. That is all. Then follow the instructions the bot gives you.
    - Treaties have 3 main components: post-war borders, reparations, and truce time. To change any aspect of a peace treaty, do `-amend <treaty name>`, then follow the instructions
    - To publish a peace treaty, which notifies all participants and allows them to ratify it, do `-publish <treaty name>` 
  - To view all your treaties, do `-treaty`. To view the terms of a specific peace treaty, you can do `-treaty <treaty name>`
  - To agree to the terms of a peace treaty, do `-ratify <treaty name>`. You may unratify a treaty by doing `-cancel ratify <treaty name>`
  - This is the logic on if non-player nations will accept a treaty or not:
    - If at least one player nation has not accepted the treaty yet, they will not accept.
    - If they have lost their capital, they will accept a treaty which sets the borders to the current frontlines
    - If they have not lost their capital, they will only accept White Peace
  - The White Peace treaty reverts back to pre-war territory and sets a 2 hour truce. It is auto-generated upon war declaration and is not changeable.
- Truces & Reparations
  - They exist as a result of treaties
  - To view all truces, do `-trucelist`. This will include the global truce.
     - While you can't declare war on someone while still in truce with them, you can still be at war with them. This happens in the case that you are called into war and the leader of the enemy side is not at truce with you, but others on their side are.
  - To view all your debts, do `-debts`. These are automatically paid, so you don't need to worry about it.
- Automatic Population Growth
  - Say goodbye to `-upgrade`! Now, your population grows automatically, depending on factors such as the buildings in your province and a new stat called **War Devastation**!
    - War Devastation is worsened by battles, bombardments, and scorches.
  - To view how much each building aids in population growth, do `-popboost`
  - The War Devastation of a specific territory is included in `-terrinfo <territory>`
  - To view a map of territories colored by their growth rate, do `-growthmap`
**Minor Additions/Changes**
- View the participants of a specific war with `-warinfo`
- If you cede someone a territory it now notifies them
- `-warmap` has been massively upgraded, and now displays your allies, truces, and NAPs alongside enemies.

## Update 1.5.1 - Diplomacy Extended
*Jan 9, 2026, 4:09 pm*
**The promised extension to the previous Diplomacy Update is here!**
### Major Additions:
- Partial Treaties
  - You can now exit a war with the permission of everyone involved in the treaty. Involvement means anyone who pays or receives reparations, loses or gains territory, or the leader of the opposite side of war.
  - In a partial treaty, any specified truce will only be between the parties of the treaty.
  - To create one, you do not need to specify anything extra, it is built in as a prompt of the `-draft` command. Leaders of a side of war cannot create a partial treaty.
- Trusted
  - You can now trust other nations, which means allow their troops into your land and allowing them to use your railways. This is not reciprocal; they do not need to accept, they just get a notification telling them they can move troops into your nation now.
  - You cannot go to war with nations you trust. You can go to war with nations that trust you. 
  - You can cancel a nation's trusted status with `-cancel trust <nation>`
    - Upon breaking trust with a nation, there is a 10 hour truce (10 hours after 8am if you break it during the midnight truce), *only if they had troops in your territory*. 
    - This is a special truce where they are allowed to still move troops within your territory in order to evacuate.
    - After this truce is over, the nation that the territory belongs to is allowed to **disband your troops**.
    - This special truce is indicated in `-trucelist`
  - Trusted is overriden by alliances. If someone you trust declares war on an ally, your trust breaks.
  - If two nations who are at war have troops in the same territory, the game automatically detects it and commences a battle.
### Minor Additions / Changes / Patches
- New command: `-nation <nation>`, which gives you general and diplomatic information about the specified nation.
- Significantly reduced the economic gain of buildings to almost 0. This excludes financial centers. Economic Boosts can be viewed with `-econboost`.
- There is now a limit on financial centers. All limits can be viewed with a new command, `-fincenters`. It's also listed in the `-nation` command. (The only way to exceed this limit would be to conquer other nation's financial centers).
- Added 3 new provinces, to avoid a previously possible naval cheat. The additions can be found in France, Sweden, and Finland.
- As a territory's population exceeds 10 million people, its growth rate grows closer to 0
- Truces now apply to belligerents in the same side of war as well
- Rewrote parts of the attack command to suit multi-nation defenses
- Patched `-rails`
- Removed coal from top power calculations
- Small wording changes here and there
- Fixed bugs relating to alliances, NAPs, wars, and treaty display

### Update 1.5.1.1
*Jan 11, 2026, 12:51 pm*
- Fixed a prevelant mistake with sending messages to channels that don't exist, which should fix the lack of responses from commands like `-attack` or -`build`

### Update 1.5.1.2 
*Jan 13, 2026, 6:13 pm*
- Fixed attacking in the very specific scenario where the defender has ships but the attacker does not

### Update 1.5.1.3 
*Jan 13, 2026, 7:03 pm*
- Moved overlapping troop resolving function to the very end of the declarewar logic (I'm pretty sure this was causing every issue thus far from the slow speed to the attack problems)

## Update 1.5.2 - Command & Control
*Feb 14, 2026, 2:48 pm*
This update is an organizational revolution, feturing two new major additions: **Theaters** and **Military Groupings!**
- Theaters
  - These are a group of territories that you can use to focus on a specific front
  - Commands associated with managing theaters are:
    - `-theater` / `-theater help` - General information about theaters
    -  `-theater list` / `-theaters` - A list of all your theaters
    - `-theater <theater name>` - Information about a specific theater
    - `-theater create` / `-theater c` - Create a theater (no other inputs required)
    -  `-theater add <theater>` / `-theater a <theater>` - Add territories to a theater (no other inputs required)
    -  `-theater remove <theater>` / `-theater r <theater>` - Remove territories from a theater (no other inputs required)
    -  `-theater delete <theater name>` / `-theater d <theater name>` - Delete an entire theater
  - The following commands have been modified to allow you to optionally specify a theater:
    - `-territories` / `-t` - You can specify a theater to shorten the list of territories
    - `-army` / `-navy` / `-forces` - You can specify a theater to shorten the list of units
- Military Groupings
   - These are groups of different types of units that move, attack, and retreat together.
   - Commands associated with managing groups are:
      - `-group` / `-group help` - General information about groups and a list of commands
     - `-group <group name> <unit IDs separated by space>` - Create a new group or add units to an existing group
     - `-ungroup <unit IDs or group names separated by space>` - Remove the units specified from their group, or removes the groups specified (does not delete the unit itself)
     - `-groupinfo <group name>` - View information about a specific group.
   - You cannot group ground troops and naval troops. You can group types within these domains though (e.g. Light Infantry and Tanks can be grouped)
   - When moving, attacking, or hauling, you cannot specify a unit that is in a group with other units. The group moves together.
### Minor Changes
