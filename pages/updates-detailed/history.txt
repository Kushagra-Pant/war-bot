## Update 1.3 - Mechanization Update 
*Feb 18, 2025, 7:06 am*
**Major Additions**
- New Units!
  - Artillery
    - Capable of attacking but not defense
  - Tanks
     - Very fast on flatter terrains
   - Fuel is also now a shop item, required for the above two as well as other pre-existing units. To view fuel requirements by type do `-fuelreq`
- Rails
  - Transport units from one station to another, if they're connected by rails
  - To view your rails, do `-rails`
  - To pave a railroad, do `-pave <territory1> <territory2>`. To view the prices do `-pave <territory> prices`
  - To move a unit from one rail station to another do `-haul <unit> <destination>`. This includes naval units! (Though moving a naval unit inland will render it useless until its moved out again)
  - To view a map of all railroads in either a nation or the world, do `-railmap <all/nation>`
  - To build a railway station do `-build <territory> Railway Station` or `-build <territory> rail`. (This command is mostly for future buildings, but has been made to include forts as well. regardless, `-fortify` still exists)
  - To find the shortest path from one territory to another, do `-pathfrom <territory1> <territory2> <(optional settings)>`.  Optional settings are `nation` (path will be contained in a nation) and `rail` (path is only between rail stations). This is useful either for deciding where to build rail or how to transport units
- Terrain
  - Affect cooldown and railroad price. To view all terrains do `-terrainmap`. 
  - To view the cooldown times by terrain for a specific unit, do `-unitcooldowns <unit>`
- Legend Map

- `-reset` - Reset command for admins only. Makes my life easier :)
**Minor Changes**
- Reduced cooldowns for naval units to hopefully get more use out of them. Submarines are the fastest, followed by destroyers, followed by carriers. All were reduced by some amount
- Changed how the shop looks
- Changed tax formula
- Removed `-toppop`. It's now `-top pop`
- Overhauled how cooldowns work. Unit cooldown based on attacking/movement is now calculated at the start instead of at the end, meaning a unit will be able to attack and move at the same time. As such, `-cooldowns att` and `-cooldowns move` have been replaced by just `-cooldowns unit`
- You can no longer cede provinces with units on it
- `-inv` will no longer display items you have 0 of
- Prices for upgrading are now based on density and terrain

  - Set the tax by doing `-settax <tax rate>`
    - There is no longer min, mod, max, or evil - you pick your people's tax rate!
    - Must be a positive integer
  - Collect tax by doing `-collect`
    - This will collect all tax even while you were inactive. You can do it a minimum of every 30 minutes (which can of course change through master settings)
    - Additionally, the longer you wait the less you will collect per hour
**Along with this, there were many, many bug fixes…**
  - Fixed a bug with the `-fuelreq` command and added a few things to `-help` (probably not enough)

  - Fixed a market bug. Now, when a nation is conquered, items they put up for sale go to the victor nation as looted items
  - Fixed a bug that occured when nations would get annexed but still have ships 
    - If these ships are carriers aboard which there are ground forces, the nation still lives to fight another day. If not, the winning nation seizes all defendant ships

  - Fixed submarine attack cooldowns, which were non existent 
  - Fixed `-wars` breaking whenever a nation is annexed

# Update 1.4 - Power & Principle
*Jul 20, 2025, 9:22 am*
**The long awaited Update 1.4 is here, reshaping international power dynamics and allowing you to shape the future of your country. Three major additions- formables, ideologies, and resources- plus tons of other changes will certainely make this update live up to the hype.**
**Major Additions**
- Formables
  - You can now form nations greater than their current meek form.
  - To view your formables, do `-form`
  - To become a formable, do `-form <formable>`. You will then adopt the name and flag of this new nation
    - You must hold onto all its territory, be at peace, and follow the ideology if any
    - You will gain much needed stability, and instant integration
  - To view a map of the formable as well as additional information, do `-formable <formable>`
  - To view the requirements needed for a formable (most notably, all its territories needed), do `-formreq <formable>`
- Ideologies
  - There are 10 ideologies in the game, each of which have certain buffs and debuffs. 
  - To view all ideologies, do `-ideologies`
  - To view the specifics of a single ideology, do `-viewide <ideology>`
  - To set your ideology, do `-setide <ideology>`. This costs 250 political power
- Resources
  - There are two types of naturally occuring resources in the game: Oil and Coal
  - Coal is produced automatically. Oil however requires an **Oil Drill** to be built on the province that has the oil
  - Coal and Oil must be processed in a **Fuel Refinery** to be converted into fuel. 
    - 1 Coal -> 0.5 Fuel
    - 1 Oil -> 1.5 Fuel
  - The above rates are every tax cooldown (so 30 minutes as of now), per fuel refinery.
  - All natural and manufactured resources are automatically added to your inventory
  - View a map of naturally occuring resources by doing `-resmap <resource>`
**Other Additions/Changes**
- Political Power: a new stat that is used to switch ideologies. It, like stability, decreases as the tax rate increases
- Battleships no longer require Ammunition, and the bugs surrounding them have been patched, hopefully
- Copius Amounts of gasoline has been removed from the market. To scorch a province, 20 fuel is required. Scorching also gets rid of all buildings, so if you're being conquered and have vital buildings you dont want to give your enemy access to, scorch the province.
- Due to the additions of Fuel Refineries, the initial price of Fuel has been raised to $600. Better get those factories running quick!
- Added a news channel, #world-news 
- You can no longer cede your final province
- `-t` territories are now sorted by descending population
- oil and coal have been added as options to `-top`
- Annexing a country results in stability gain except if you're a democracy
- New command,`-buildmap <building>`, that shows all buildings built so far

   - Changed `-buy` confirmation message to have cleaner looking numbers
   - fixed `-bombard` bug where battleship could bombard any coastal province

## Update 1.4.4 - The Advertisement Update
*Aug 10, 10:40 am*
- A new Advertisement Channel, #advertisements, and a command to go with it: `-broadcast <message>`. To view the cost of a potential message, do `-broadcast cost <message>`
  - You can only  broadcast once every 8 hours, to not clog the channel. I can change this.
- Additionally, I integrated AI (yes, Artificial Intelligence) into the `-help` command. Now it won't be broken whenever you ask it questions!
- Some more admin-only commands made:
  - `-setad`: Sets the channel for the ad
  - `-cleantroops`: Removes every troop not part of a nation that exists
  - `-refresh`: restarts the bot
  - And, a new log channel added that logs all information about attacks, so I can identify bugs more easily
- Changed some ideology properties 
- Reworked some internal organization
