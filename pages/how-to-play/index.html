          <p class="card-text">
            Money makes the world go round, and it's no different for War Bot. Do <span class="command">-settax &lt;rate&gt;</span> to set your tax rate, then do <span class="command">-collect</span> to collect your income. You can collect once every tax cycle, which is currently set to 30 minutes.
            The higher your tax rate, the greater your stability loss will be.
            The more frequently you collect, the more money you will get, though you will continue collecting even when afk.
            Income is affected by stability, population size, integration, and infrastructure. To view the effects of the latter two, do <span class="command">-econboost</span>.

            These are added up for your total army strength. Then, it is squared, and chances are calculated based off that. For example, 1 light infantry vs 1 tank is a 1v9 in terms of strength, so the light infantry has a 10% chance of winning. But 2 light infantry vs 1 tank is a 4v9 in terms of strength, so a ~31% chance of winning.

          <p class="card-text">
            Railways are used to reduce troop cooldowns and move units (including ships) from one side of the country to another. However, they are quite expensive to build. They do provide an economic boost to the territory they're in, however.
            <br>
            There are 2 components to railways: The Railway Stations and the rails. Each railway must have 2 railway stations and have them connected via rails. Only then can troops be hauled between them.
            <br>
            As stated, cooldowns from hauling are significantly less than regular movement, plus require a lot less planning. You can also build railways in unintegrated territories, allowing for deeper and faster expansion into other nations.
            <br>
            To pave a railroad between two territories or view the prices, use <a href="../command-list/#pave"><span class="command">-pave</span></a>.
            <br>
            To view all your railways, do <span class="command">-rails</span>. To view a map of railways, do <span class="command">-railmap &lt;'all' / nation &gt;</span>
            <br>
            To find the shortest path from one territory to another, do <a href="../command-list/#pathfrom"><span class="command">-pathfrom</span></a> This is useful either for deciding where to build rail or how to transport units.

            There are two resources in the game, Coal and Oil. Both are used for fuel production, which is neccessary for motorized infantry, artillery, tanks, rails, and a navy. <br> <br>
            You can view a map of resources by doing <span class="command">-resmap &lt; coal / oil &gt;</span>. You can also view the top countries by resource reserves by doing <span class="command">-top &lt; coal / oil &gt;</span>. Resource reserves are also listed in <span class="command">-terrinfo &lt;territory&gt;</span>.<br>
            Coal is produced automatically. Every tax cycle, you gain the amount listed in <span class="command">-resmap coal</span> or <span class="command">-terrinfo</span> for that territory. For example, if the tax cycle is 30 minutes, and your coal reserves for a territory are listed as 0.3, you gain 0.3 coal per 30 minutes.
            Oil is the same, except you require an Oil Drill to begin production. Contrary to real life, these resources are infinite and never run out. <br> <br>
            To convert Coal or Oil into Fuel, you need to build a Fuel Refinery using the <a href="../command-list/#build"><span class="command">-build</span></a> command. The fuel refinery has a maximum intake of 1 resource per tax cycle, no matter the resource type, nation stability, ideology, etc.
            As you can probably guess, Coal is less efficient than Fuel. Every 1 Coal convert to 0.5 Fuel, while every 1 Oil converts to 1.5 Fuel.
